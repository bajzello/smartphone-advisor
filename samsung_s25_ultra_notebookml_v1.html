            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a high-end smartphone that debuted in January 2025 and was released on February 3, 2025 [6, 7]. It is the flagship model of the Samsung brand [7]. It features a durable build with titanium frame and Corning's glare-free glass (Gorilla Glass Armor 2 for the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for the back) [8-11]. Key features include an integrated S Pen, IP68 dust and water resistance, and 45W wired charging [8-10, 12].
            </p>
            <p>
                While some reviews suggest it plays it safe and might not be the absolute "best" in every single category compared to competitors [13-15], it is described as a very good, or even "awesome" phone [14, 15]. One review calls it the most enticing phone Samsung has ever made and the closest to being an iPhone killer [16]. However, it's also noted that the overall image quality might be below competitors in its price segment [17].

            <h2>Camera</h2>
            <p>
                Features an advanced quad-camera system on the rear and a single selfie camera [42].
            </p>
            <h3>Rear Cameras:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Main (Wide): 200 MP, f/1.7, 24mm, 1/1.3", 0.6µm, multi-directional PDAF, OIS. Sensor: Samsung ISOCELL HP2 [8, 42, 45].</li>

            </ul>
             <p>Both telephoto lenses have OIS [48, 50]. The camera rings around the lenses are slightly more pronounced [28, 51].</p>
            <h3>Selfie Camera:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Single: 12 MP, f/2.2, 26mm, 1/3.2", 1.12µm, dual pixel PDAF. Sensor: Samsung S5K3LU [8, 42, 52].</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Reviews on camera performance are mixed. DXOMARK notes solid performance in tele and video in bright light conditions but overall image quality below competitors [17]. Some reviews praise daytime photos and specific zoom levels [49, 59] and mention great autofocus [15], while others note poor night photos unless using pro mode [60] and sometimes overprocessed images [15]. The camera UI has improvements making it easier to swap between lenses and settings [53].
            </p>
             <p>DXOMark Score: Mobile 146, Photo 144, Video 143 [48]. User opinions give the camera a 9.1/10 overall [60].</p>

            <h2>Software and AI Features</h2>
            <p>
                Runs on Android 15 with One UI 7 [6-9, 70, 71]. Samsung promises up to 7 major Android upgrades and 7 years of security patches [6, 8, 70]. One UI 7 is described as potentially the best Android OS [72].
            </p>
            <p>
                A major focus is on AI features, described as the biggest new features [73]. However, the AI is currently only free until the end of 2025, with unknown costs thereafter [74].
            </p>
            <h3>Key AI Features Mentioned:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gemini Integration: Hold to activate Gemini is a step up from Google Assistant [75]. It can handle complex commands [76]. Gemini Extensions allow accessing data from apps like email to add events to the calendar [77].</li>
                <li>AI Select: Described as a game changer for quickly selecting text from paragraphs or screen grabbing items in chats [75]. Can be mapped to the side button [75].</li>
                <li>Circle to Search: Still a preferred feature for some users [78].</li>
                <li>AI Wallpaper Generation: Considered probably the best on any phone, offering fast, high-quality options that match the UI colour palette [79].</li>
                <li>Multi-step Gemini/Samsung Integration: Allows combining finding information and then performing an action (e.g., finding a restaurant and texting it) [80-82].</li>
                <li>Daily Briefs (AI): Shows calendar, weather, news, Spotify playlists [73, 77]. Some reviewers found it not very useful or timely [73, 77, 83, 84].</li>
                <li>Gemini Live: Allows getting context on what's on your screen, including summarising YouTube videos or asking clarifying questions [79, 85, 86].</li>
                <li>Interpreter Mode: Can facilitate almost real-time conversation in another language, though execution can be flawed [87, 88].</li>
                <li>Call Recording with AI Summarization: Allows recording calls, searching transcripts, and getting summaries, but the transcription accuracy can be poor [89].</li>
                <li>Now Bar (AI): Sits on the lock screen, similar to Apple's Dynamic Island [84, 90]. Can provide live updates for specific sports [84, 90, 91]. Some reviewers like its integration with sports and find it convenient [84, 91].</li>
                <li>Article Summary (AI): Works in Samsung's internet browser and is noted as fast [91].</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Reviews on AI features are mixed. Some features are praised (AI Select, AI Wallpaper, multi-step commands, Circle to Search) [75, 78-82], while others are seen as needing improvement or not very useful (Daily Briefs, Interpreter mode, Call summary accuracy) [73, 77, 83, 84, 87-89]. The level of intelligence to understand requests exists, but the context understanding is sometimes missing [90, 92, 93].

            <h2>S Pen</h2>
            <p>
                The S Pen is an integrated, super precise stylus [9, 94]. It has been part of the Ultra line since the S22 [94].
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                A significant change this year is the <span class="highlight">removal of the Bluetooth functionality</span> from the S Pen [26, 95, 96]. This means it can no longer be used as a remote camera shutter or for media playback controls [95, 96]. The old S Pen with Bluetooth does not fit in the new phone [95]. Samsung justified this by saying data showed less than 1% of users activated this feature [97]. Some reviewers see this removal as a "sneaky" downgrade [96], going against the "Ultra" concept of adding extra features for enthusiasts [54, 97, 98]. The S25 Ultra appears capable of providing power to the S Pen, but the new S Pen without a battery cannot receive it [99]. It's suggested Samsung might upsell a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen in the future [99].
